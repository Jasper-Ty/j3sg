## About

I'm a senior Computer Engineering student at Drexel University. Currently, I work as a software engineer at MOD.

I program and study a lot of math in my free time, and I also love to draw and produce music. I have a Pi 4 and two Arduino Mega 2560's which I do hobby electronics with.

I'm a fairly good Minesweeper player. I'm currently ranked #456 on the [Authoritative Minesweeper](https://minesweepergame.com/world-rankings.php) rankings.
