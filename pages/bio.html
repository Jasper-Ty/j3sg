        </header>

        <main>
            <p>I grew up in both the Philippines and Saudi Arabia. Currently, I'm based in Philadelphia, as both a Computer Engineering student at Drexel University and a Software Developer at MOD.</p>

<p>I'm planning to pursue an academic career in pure math. I've always had a very strong passion for it, and spent much of my free time in college studying math. I'm particularly interested in the intersection between math and computer science.</p>
